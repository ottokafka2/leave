# 2024-01-24
Starting from today, trying to keep on make diaries but in English not matter how
shitty my English is.

I realise that no matter how old I am, even if I understand the wisdom of 
'Don't cry over spilled milk' and try to calm myself every fucking time, still
I get panic. Huh. I guess that will always be who I am, always a child.

As I am typing, `White Horse` is playing. This is my favorite Taylor Swift song. It is
a odd choice since I don't think many people recognize this TS song. Even time I listen
to this song, I feel like I am dragged into younger time when I was still in high school.
I understand the fact that high school is, in some way, a nightmare. However, this feeling of
nostalgia can not be erased. I always amazed by how my classmates being so innocent and peaceful,
they were not thinking about how to hurt people or what. The canteen was awful, the classroom was cold in
 the winter and hot in the summer, the playground was so small and the dormitory was crawling with cockroaches.
In the meantime, I missed when the sun was about to come down, I sit by the window in the classroom and watched
people entering the school gate and talking. I missed when I walked in circles in the playground with my friends.
I missed when the wind would go through the dormitory and brought everything into life.

## Talk

I am getting acquainted with a peer student in the same apartment. I want to look back and
take a review on myself. Am I doing enough when I was at her age. I don't think so.
I was short-sighted. Looking back my past life, I was a toddler when I entered university, while others
 were already adults. I was not sophisticated enough and knew nothing about this world. I left the city I grew up,
when I was 17. I never knew how to type words on keyboard, I was wearing underwear with brand _Calvin Klien_ or some other
 fake brands, I did not know how to take a subway.

Don't be sad. I have already passed the phase of self-pity. I recognise my progress, my half-completeness,
my hard work. To me and those who struggled and stumbled, I am proud of you for being consistent and strong.
Life is never a fairytale. No family in China is wholesome. You are never alone. To quote from fleabag, 'It will pass'.
This is a comfort blanket for me. It looks like talking about love. I want to extend it to wider places.
Everything will pass. Nothing lasts forever. Just live your life. Fuck it. Fuck societal norms,
fuck others' bullshit opinions, always, follow your heart. Don't be afraid of taking a break, you deserve it.
Take you pace. I am with you.
