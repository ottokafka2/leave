I have been looking for a place to stay for a long time.
I have already learnt that I should not stay negative.
As I am writing down these words, I am in the library.
I forced myself to stay in a different place.
If I stay in the apartment, I felt rotten.

Things go back in the first half year. Many Chinese students chose to
stay in Leiden where a new student apartment had been opened. I chose
not to follow. I joined in lottery every week. I got no luck every week.

The deadline is at Aug 12th, which means I have only 15 days to find a new place to stay.
I felt horrified. I asked mom to try to ask for Buddha, for Mazu, for local
gods. Mom comforted me. She said she asked, and everything would be alright.
She told me not to worry. It is right about time for me to find a good place.

There is a ceremony called Pue. The religious will say the pray and then throw out
the Pue to ask for an answer. If the Pue exhibits good result (one Pue is on the head,
another Pue is on the back), the religious finish pray. If not, the religious try to
make better negotiation and repeat.

Mom said the process of Pue went smoothly. There is nothing for me to worry about.

I tried every day. I joined in the lottery, I added myself into the lining queue, and
I sent out messages in Karmernet. So far I only get one message back.
Other than that, nothing.

My only one message back came from the user in Karmernet, who told me there would be 5
candidates, and we would all take a tour in different time slot tomorrow.

A tour means an interview. An interview is something that I am incapable of.
I am worried.

I am constantly worried.

How could I not be? I want answers too. Will I fuck it up? Will I be okay? If I fuck it
up, will I be able to find a new house?
Will be happy ever? Will my life be better?

Life is an unsolved mystery, I guess. I have to constantly get hurt and move on and again.
