#2024-07-02 Cloudy, Sometime rain

Finally, I am back in this little world. It is been a long time. At first I decided
whenever I felt down, I needed to go to my diary and write everything down. Well,
I broke the promise. I felt down all the time, but I ate then up myself. Why am I here
today then? Well, I don't know. Maybe it is because I kind of fell my heart is full.
It can not contain any more feelings. I need to let it out a bit before it overflows.
What are my problems? Well, a lot.

I am try to find the next year commendation, but I got no luck. The other day I got a
mental breakdown because of this housing problem. The overwhelming feeling came back.
I am a loser. I am shit. I can not do anything right. I will never get over this moment
when I feel I should not exist. Many of my friends moved to Leiden as there was a new 
building with many student commendation vacancies. I said I did not want to move to
another city so I did not move with them. In fact, deep down, I felt like I should not
be too close to other people. Not to mention we would live in the same building and share
much more life together. I was positive at first, about the house. Well, jokes on me.
Now I wanna cry everyday, except I do not know how to cry. Not in my skill sets.
I always thought friends are in my harbour, whenever I felt down, I can turn to them and find
comfort. I was kind of wrong. I mean, we are not acquainted with each other so much as I imagine.
Something upset me is that everytime after I try to earn some comfort from my friends,
she will make a limit time post with status 'happy'. I felt shamed. I felt mocked.
Things should not be like this. I always said communication is the most important thing,
but no, I can not say everything. Should I say that you can not feel happt when I am feeling
down? That is selfish. Of course, I have other friends. I can not turn to them. I am
alone. And I know, I should sort things out myself, but I constantly fell helpless.
Why I am the one who can not depend on others? I fell so tired.
Maybe after I finish finding a new house, I will feel settled, but gods know when it is.
Right now I just want to cry over and over again. My aching heart. A little cup with
a black cat on it appears to have little cracks. Everything hot water poured in, the
cracks appear to be more clear.
