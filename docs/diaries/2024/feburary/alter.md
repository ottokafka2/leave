# 2024-02-05 Super windy
First day of the new period, chaos. 28min of biking to science park and 30 more minutes to
bike back. Left my pc charger at the school, I feel anxiety, although the true feeling of anxiety came from
a Chinese female TA. I learnt the ideas of not giving shit to others' bad attitude, but I can not help it.
I asked about an extensive project with limited spots and she gave such aggressive energy like she was not a Chinese.
Well, lady, you are. Chinese never gave up pushing themselves. Anyways, in some way, I also needed to reflect on myself.

The trip back home was super windy, I felt like dying. I hoped sincerely, everything will be okay.

I should use alter my life more rather than change my life, much fancier.
