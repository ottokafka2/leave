# 2024-01-24 super sunny weather
Actually I've got nothing to record today. I just stayed all day at home and tried to prepare
for the exam. In amsterdam, usually you see the good weather and then, in the next
ten minutes, it became cloudy. Today was one of the exception. I saw an airplane flying over
the sky, leaving a trace of cloud. Just like childhood days. I sat in a bench and watched 
the plane flying. It was a small town without any skyscraper. I could watch them flying for a
long long time. They were so high above me, so untouchable. I have always wondered what it was
like to be in a plane, away from this little town.

I am always incapable of sensing my life. In anther words, I don't know how to live
a life. For example, now I am in a total different city, different country, but I can
not have a clear acknowledgement. I have to learn, I always have to.

## A good meal and deep talk

Last sunday, four days ago, I was invited to join in a dinner. It was pleasant.
The meal included Risotto, Shredded chicken and tahini sauce, beef and potato shreds.
TBH I had not had decent meal for a long time. It was satisfying.

They were a gay couple, one from China and another from Poland. They were nice. First,
I could finally practice my English. Second, they really knew China so well, and we shared
so many common opinions. We talked about fantastic Chinese good. I was surprised that they
even know about Guizhou. We reached an agreement: Guizhou was underrated and Xi'an was
overrated. Yeah! That had always been my insight. I was happy to have this common sense with
them.

We also shared some views on politics. You, who were reading this, should understand: This is a shitty
world. You could only choose to be shitty or less shitty. We all agreed, one person, who shall we remain
nameless, deserved to end his life. Things could not be any worse and yet, it just was.
Freedom, again another agreement, was the most important. It was so difficult to predict to future.
We could hardly keep optimistic, but we sincerely hoped everything would be alright.

I asked something about the work environment and job interview. Huh, things could not be any easier
for so many europeans, right. 29 annual leaves, unlimited sick leaves and 20 days for employees working
in home country. There were no such things as leaves without pay here. OMG. How I wished I was not born
in where I was born. I was already worried about my job interview. :( I know I was competent for
any jobs I would apply, but... How I wished I was more wholesome, ideal. That sounds ridiculous, but 
you know what I meant.

Anyways, keep going and don't turn back.
