## Brilliant weather today.

The pigeon can live a better life than me. Truth.

Every day I have to take a ferry to the other side of the river. It is quite funny.
There was a day when a street singer came in and gave us a song. His voice was quite enjoyable.
I could not help but gave him applause after he finished. Surprisingly, only a few people
clapped for him. I guessed Dutch people in someway were also cold-blooded. People always talked
about how Dutch were much alike to Chinese. I could not deny it. Dutch people work harder than
I imagine. You can see from the above picture, well, they do not dress fancy. Not even fancier than
people in Chongqing.

## Mental Breakdown yesterday

Yesterday I had a mental breakdown after came back from school. I came to school in confidence for my pitch.
However, there was an arrogant white male TA with ridiculous hairstyle only followed rigid style of evaluation.
In the assignment, as I quote: " that the specification says nothing
about the contents of the body of a request; this is left for you to decide." When I wanted to
do the pitch, he said we had to stick to the test script, which defined shitty parameter names and headers.
Why don't we give a round of applause for this most ridiculous requirement of all time.
Anyway, I have to stay here to change the test script to generate passed result.(Well, whatever, I just
want to pass even if modification of test script was forbidden). Compared with him, another two Chinese TA were so lovely and cute. Yang took the position
of evaluating our work as the white male said he had no enough time. Yang was being reasonable and told us
we could edit the test script and showed the passed result. I loved him! That was how you should
behave. Everyone could see how inhuman it was to change our code to shit to match the test script(Which I did after I came home).

I was upset still. Perfectionism again. I blamed myself for not seeing it coming.
I blamed myself for not preparing enough. I blamed myself for being upset about
this tiny thing. Even worse, I could not control myself for being trapped in this 
emotional swamp.

I tried to reach out to friends. Well, not well. I understood that we were so different
in so many ways(just like we were so alike in some many ways). They could not get my feelings
and also why I needed to let it out by talking to others. Instead, I tried to talk to others
about other random things. About their recent status, about their today's routine, about their
future trip. Fortunately, I healed up quickly. Oh, I was proud of myself. Keep it up.
