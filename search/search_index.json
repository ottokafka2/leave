record today. I just stayed all day at home and tried to prepare for the exam. In amsterdam, usually you see the good weather and then, in the next ten minutes, it became cloudy. Today was one of the exception. I saw an airplane flying over the sky, leaving a trace of cloud. Just like childhood days. I sat in a bench and watched  the plane flying. It was a small town without any skyscraper. I could watch them flying for a long long time. They were so high above me, so untouchable. I have always wondered what it was like to be in a plane, away from this little town.</p> <p>I am always incapable of sensing my life. In anther words, I don't know how to live a life.

It was pleasant. The meal included Risotto, Shredded chicken and tahini sauce, beef and potato shreds. TBH I had not had decent meal for a long time. It was satisfying.</p> <p>They were a gay couple, one from China and another from Poland. They were nice. First, I could finally practice my English. Second, they really knew China so well, and we shared so many common opinions. We talked about fantastic Chinese good. I was surprised that they even know about Guizhou. We reached an agreement: Guizhou was underrated and Xi'an was overrated. Yeah! That had always been my insight. I was happy to have this common sense with them.</p> <p>We also shared some views on politics. You, who were reading this, should understand: This is a shitty world. You could only choose to be shitty or less shitty. We all agreed, one person, who shall we remain nameless, deserved to end his life. Things could not be any worse and yet, it just was. Freedom, again another agreement, was the most important. It was so difficult to predict to future. We could hardly keep optimistic, but we sincerely hoped everything would be alright.</p> <p>I asked something about the work environment and job interview. Huh, things could not be any easier for so many europeans, right. 29 annual leaves, unlimited sick leaves and 20 days for employees working in home country. There were no such things as leaves without pay here. OMG. How I wished I was not born in where I was born. I was already worried about my job interview. :( I know I was competent for any jobs I would apply, but... How I wished I was more wholesome, ideal. That sounds ridiculous, but  you know what I meant.</p> <p>Anyways, keep going and don't turn back.</p>"},{"location":"diaries/2024/january/talk/","title":"A Talk","text":""},{"location":"diaries/2024/january/talk/#2024-01-24","title":"2024-01-24","text":"<p>Starting from today, trying to keep on make diaries but in English no matter how shitty my English is.</p> <p>I realise that no matter how old I am, even if I understand the wisdom of  'Don't cry over spilled milk' and try to calm myself every fucking time, still I get panic.

It is a odd choice since I don't think many people recognize this TS song. Every time I listen to this song, I feel like I am dragged into younger time when I was still in high school. I understand the fact that high school is, in some way, a nightmare. However, this feeling of nostalgia can not be erased. I always amazed by how my classmates being so innocent and peaceful, they were not thinking about how to hurt people or what. The canteen was awful, the classroom was cold in  the winter and hot in the summer, the playground was so small and the dormitory was crawling with cockroaches. In the meantime, I missed when the sun was about to come down, I sit by the window in the classroom and watched people entering the school gate and talking. I missed when I walked in circles in the playground with my friends. I missed when the wind would go through the dormitory and brought everything into life. And the canteen, ewwww. Sorry,  canteen is the worst.</p>"},{"location":"diaries/2024/january/talk/#talk","title":"Talk","text":"<p>I am getting acquainted with a peer student in the same apartment. I want to look back and take a review on myself. Am I doing enough when I was at her age. I don't think so. I was short-sighted. Looking back my past life, I was a toddler when I entered university, while others  were already adults. I was not sophisticated enough and knew nothing about this world. I left the city I grew up, when I was 17. I never knew how to type words on keyboard, I was wearing underwear with brand Calvin Klien or some other  fake brands, I did not know how to take a subway.</p> <p>Don't be sad. I have already passed the phase of self-pity. I recognise my progress, my half-completeness, my hard work. To me and those who struggled and stumbled, I am proud of you for being consistent and strong. Life is never a fairytale. No family in China is wholesome. You are never alone. To quote from fleabag, 'It will pass'. This is a comfort blanket for me. It looks like talking about love. I want to extend it to wider places. Everything will pass. Nothing lasts forever. Just live your life. Fuck it. Fuck societal norms, fuck others' bullshit opinions, always, follow your heart. Don't be afraid of taking a break, you deserve it. Take you pace. I am with you.</p>"}]}
